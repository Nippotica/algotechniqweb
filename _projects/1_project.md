### Objective
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-enabled accident detection and alert system specifically designed for smart cities. The system integrates IoT (Internet of Things) with deep learning techniques to enhance accident detection accuracy and improve response times for rescue operations.

### Prior Work
Accident detection and alert systems have previously relied on simpler technologies such as GPS data, accelerometers, and basic machine learning algorithms {% cite su142214859 %}. However, they often had limitations such as dependency on a single sensor, high false alarm rates, and lack of comprehensive integration with emergency services.

### Benefits
The new approach benefits city authorities, emergency services (like hospitals and police stations), vehicle owners, and the general public. By providing real-time, accurate accident detection and immediate alerting of relevant services, the system can significantly reduce response times, potentially saving lives and reducing the severity of injuries from road accidents.

### Enabling Technologies
The key enabling technologies include:

   - Deep Learning: Pre-trained models like EfficientNet and Vision Transformers (ViT) are used to analyze accident data and minimize false detection rates.
   - Cloud Computing: Used for processing and storing data and for running deep learning models.
   - Communication Modules: 5G and Wi-Fi modules to transmit data and alerts to emergency services.

### Key Performance Indicators
The success of the new approach can be quantified using various performance metrics, including:
   - Accuracy of Accident Detection: Measured through precision, recall, and F1 score of the deep learning models.
   - False Alarm Rate: The system's ability to minimize false positives in accident detection.
   - Response Time: The time taken to alert emergency services after an accident is detected.
